      title: "The Tale of Three Brothers",
      storie: "There were once three brothers who were traveling along a lonely, winding road at twilight. In time, the brothers reached a river too deep to wade through and too dangerous to swim across. However, these brothers were learned in the magical arts, and so they simply waved their wands and made a bridge appear across the treacherous water. They were halfway across it when they found their path blocked by a hooded figure. And Death spoke to them. He was angry that he had been cheated out of three new victims, for travelers usually drowned in the river. But Death was cunning. He pretended to congratulate the three brothers upon their magic and said that each had earned a prize for having been clever enough to evade him. So the oldest brother, who was a combative man, asked for a wand more powerful than any in existence: a wand that must always win duels for its owner, a wand worthy of a wizard who had conquered Death! So Death crossed to an elder tree on the banks of the river, fashioned a wand from a branch that hung there, and gave it to the oldest brother. Then the second brother, who was an arrogant man, decided that he wanted to humiliate Death still further, and asked for the power to recall others from Death. So Death picked up a stone from the riverbank and gave it to the second brother, and told him that the stone would have the power to bring back the dead. And then Death asked the third and youngest brother what he would like.  The youngest brother was the humblest and also the wisest of the brothers, and he did not trust Death. So he asked for something that would enable him to go forth from that place without being followed by Death. And death, most unwillingly, handed over his own Cloak of Invisibility. Then Death stood aside and allowed the three brothers to continue on their way, and they did so, talking with wonder of the adventure they had had, and admiring Death’s gifts. In due course the brothers separated, each for his own destination. The first brother traveled on for a week or more, and reaching a distant village, sought out a fellow wizard with whom he had a quarrel. Naturally with the Elder Wand as his weapon, he could not fail to win the duel that followed. Leaving his enemy dead upon the floor, the oldest brother proceeded to an inn, where he boasted loudly of the powerful wand he had snatched from Death himself, and of how it made him invincible. That very night, another wizard crept upon the oldest brother as he lay, wine-sodden, upon his bed. The thief took the wand and, for good measure, slit the oldest brother’s throat. And so Death took the first brother for his own. Meanwhile, the second brother journeyed to his own home, where he lived alone. Here he took out the stone that had the power to recall the dead, and turned it thrice in his hand. To his amazement and his delight, the figure of the girl he had once hoped to marry, before her untimely death, appeared at once before him.Yet she was sad and cold, separated from him as by a veil. Though she had returned to the mortal world,she did not truly belong there and suffered. Finally the second brother, driven mad with hopeless longing, killed himself so as truly to join her. And so Death took the second brother for his own. But though Death searched for the third brother for many years, he was never able to find him. It was only when he had attained a great age that the youngest brother finally took off the Cloak of Invisibility and gave it to his son. And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life.",

      title: "Babbity Rabbity and Her Cackling Stump",
      storie: "A long time ago, in a land far away, there was a kingdom ruled by a foolish King who decided that he should be the only one to have magical powers. He formed an army, which he called the Brigade of Witch-Hunters, and armed them with black hounds. At the same time, he wanted an Instructor in Magic, so he made calls for a wizard or witch from one of the nearby villages to teach him. Of course, nobody dared to volunteer, except for a cunning charlatan who had no magical powers. He convinced the foolish King that he would be able to teach him by performing a few simple tricks. He was then appointed as the Grand Sorcerer in Chief, the King's Private Magic Master. Once in position, the charlatan told the King that he needed money so that he could purchase a magic wand, precious rubies for casting charms and silver chalices for storing potions. This was another trick; the charlaton only wanted the treasures for himself. He stored them in his house and returned to the palace, unaware that he was being watched. Babbitty, the King's washerwoman, saw the charlatan snapping two twigs from one of the King's trees and disappearing into the palace. The charlatan gave one of the twigs to the King, assuring him that it was a powerful wand. A wand, however, that would only work when the King was worthy of its powers. Each morning the King and the charlatan practiced in the grounds, shouting nonsense whilst waving around their wands.  One morning Babbitty was watching their foolishness from the window of her little cottage. She laughed so loud that the King could hear her, which made him very upset and instantly stop his chanting. He was fed up of practising and wanted results.  The King decided that the next day he would invite all the court to watch him performing magic with the help of his teacher. The charlatan tried to back off by saying that he had to go out of town but the King threatened to send the Brigade of Witch-Hunters after him. The King went back to his palace leaving the charlaton alone and afraid, knowing that the King would not be able to perform magic and he could not help him. Looking to vent his anger and fear he turned to the washerwoman's window. The next morning all the Lords and Ladies assembled in the palace, coming to watch the King performing magic. The crowd was both amused and astonished by the disappearance of a hat and a levitating horse, all done with the help of Babbity. Then, the Captain of the Brigade of Witch-Hunters asked the King if he could revive his dead dog. The King waved his wand to perform a spell but nothing happened. Babbitty hadn't even bothered to raise her wand, knowing that magic couldn't bring the dead back to life. The crowd laughed at the King, and wanted to know why his magic was not working. The charlatan pointed at the bush and told the crowd that an evil witch was blocking the King's magic. When the Brigade released their hounds to chase her, Babbitty fled from the bush. She reached a low hedge and vanished from sight. When the assembled crowd caught up, they found the hounds barking and scrabbling around a tree. The charlatan told the crowd that Babbitty had turned herself into a tree, and that they should cut down the tree. While the tree was being cut down, the crowd started to leave, but suddenly there was a cackling coming from the stump. Babbitty told all of them that a true wizard or witch cannot be cut in half, and she suggested that they should cut the charlatan to prove it. The charlatan confessed all of his wickedness, and he was brought to the dungeon to be punished.Babbitty told them that because they had cut a witch in half the King was now cursed; he would feel an axe stroke him every time the Brigade harmed a witch or wizard. Fearing the curse, the King declared that no harm would be brought to any wizard or witch again. Babbitty asked the King to build a statue of herself as a reminder of his foolishness. The King promised it would be done and ordered for a statue of her, which would be made of gold, to be erected. After the crowdhad dispersed, a rabbit appeared out of a hole in the stump with a wand in its mouth. Babbity had been hiding in the stump the whole time. She left the kingdom but forever after the statue of Babbitty remained on top of the stump, and no witch or wizard was hurt in that kingdom ever again.",

      title: "The Wizard and the Hopping Pot",
      storie: "There was once a kindly old wizard who used his magic generously and wisely for the benefit of his neighbors. Rather than reveal the true source of his power, he pretended that his potions, charms and antidotes sprang ready-made from the little cauldron he called his lucky cooking pot. From miles around people came to him with their troubles, and the wizard was pleased to give his pot a stir and put things right. This well-beloved wizard lived to a goodly age, then died, leaving all his chatells to his only son. This son was of a very different disposition to his gentle father. Those who could not work magic were, to the son’s mind, worthless, and he had often quarreled with his father’s habit of dispensing magical aid to their neighbours. Upon the father’s death, the son found hidden inside the old cooking pot a small package bearing his name. He opened it, hoping for gold, but found instead a soft, thick slipper, much to small to wear, and with no pair. A fragment of parchment within the slipper bore the words “In the fond hope, my son, that you will never need it.” The son cursed his father’s age-softened mind, then threw the slipper back into the cauldron resolving to use it henceforth as a rubbish pail. That very night a peasant woman knocked on the front door. “My granddaughter is afflicted by a crop of warts, sir,” she told him. “Your father used to mix a special poultice in that old cooking pot -” “Begone!” cried the son. “What care I for you brat’s warts?” And he slammed the door in the old woman’s face. At once there came a loud clanging and banging from his kitchen. The wizard lit his wand and opened the door, and there, to his amazement, he saw his father’s old cooking pot: it had sprouted a single foot of brass, and was hopping on the spot, in the middle of the floor, making a fearful noise upon the flagstones. The wizard approached it in wonder, but fell back hurriedly when he saw that the whole of the pot’s surface was covered in warts. “Disgusting object!” he cried, and he tried firstly to Vanish the pot, then to clean it by magic, and finally to force it out of the house. None of his spells worked, however, and he was unable to prevent the pot hopping after him out of the kitchen, and then following him up to bed, clanging and banging loudly on every wooden stair. The wizard could not sleep all night for the banging of the warty old pot by his bedside, and next morning the pot insisted upon hopping after him to the breakfast table. Clang, clang, clang, went the brass-footed pot, and the wizard had not even started his porridge when there came another knock on the door. An old man stood on the doorstep. ” ‘Tis my old donkey, sir,” he explained. “Lost she is, or stolen and without her I cannot take my wares to market, and my family will go hungry tonight.” “And I am hungry now!” roared the wizard, and slammed the door upon the old man. Clang, clang, clang, went the cooking pot’s single brass foot upon the floor, but now its clamour was mixed with the brays of a donkey and human groans of hunger, echoing from the depths of the pot. “Be still. Be silent!” shrieked the wizard, but not all his magical powers could quieten the warty pot, which hopped at his heels all day, braying and groaning and clanging, no matter where he went or what he did. That evening there came a third knock upon the door, and there on the threshold sood a young woman sobbing as though her heart would break. “My baby is grievously ill,” she said. “Won’t you help us? Your father bade me come if troubled-” But the wizard slammed the door on her. And now the tormenting pot filled to the brim with salt water, and slopped tears all over the floor as it hopped, and brayed, and groaned, and sprouted more warts. Though no more villagers came to seek help at the wizard’s cottage for the rest of the week, the pot kept him informed of their many ills. Within a few days, it was not only braying and groaning and slopping and hopping and sprouting warts, it was also choking and retching, crying like a baby, whining like a dog, and spewing out bad cheese and sour milk and a plague of hungry slugs. The wizard could not sleep or eat with the pot beside him, but the pot refused to leave and he could not silence it or force it to be still. At last the wizard could bear it no more. “Bring me all your problems, all your troubles and your woes!” he screamed, fleeing into the night, with the pot hopping behind him along the road into the village. “Come! Let me cure you, mend you and comfort you! I have my father’s cooking pot, and I shall make you well!” And with the foul pot still bounding along behind him, he ran up the street, casting spells in every direction. Inside one house the little girl’s warts vanished as she slept; the lost donkey was Summoned from a distant briar patch and set down softly in its stable; the sick baby was doused in dittany and woke, well and rosy. At every house of sickness and sorrow, the wizard did his best, and gradually the cooking pot beside him stopped groaning and retching, and became quiet, shiny and clean. “Well, Pot?” asked the trembling wizard, as the sun began to rise. The pot burped out the single slipper he had thrown to it, and permitted him to fit it on to the brass foot. Together, they set off back to the wizard’s house, the pot’s footstep muffled at last. But from that day forward, the wizard helped the villagers like his father before him, lest the pot cast off its slipper, and begin to hop once more.",
